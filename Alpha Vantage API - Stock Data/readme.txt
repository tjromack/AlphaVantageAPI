Simple historic data extract ustilizing the Alpha Advantage API; Chose three companies at random for testing but code can easily be edited to target any listed organization.

I chose three fortune 500 companies: Apple Inc (AAPL) - Tech, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) - Health,
and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) - Energy. Each company representing diverse industries and can 
hopefully provide interesting insights.

I wrote a data collection script that retrieves stock data of these three companies, stores them
in a CSV, as well as a pandas dataframe.

Once the data was stored, I used different python methods to check/handle missing values & inconsistencies.
